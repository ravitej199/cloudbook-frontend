# CloudBook - Portfolio Project

CloudBook is a **full-stack web application** built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express.js** for the backend. This project showcases my skills in building a **modern, scalable web application** with database integration, API development, and responsive UI design.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup system.
- **Content Management**: Users can create, edit, and manage content.
- **Database Integration**: Stores user and content data efficiently.
- **REST API Development**: Backend services designed using Express.js.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on all devices.

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React.js (for dynamic UI rendering)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling and responsiveness)
- JavaScript

### **Backend**
- Node.js (runtime environment)
- Express.js (server-side framework)
- MongoDB (database for storing user data and content)

## Installation & Setup

### **Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd cloudbook-backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```sh
   cd cloudbook-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Folder Structure

### **Backend (`cloudbook-backend`)**
- `index.js` - Entry point of the backend server.
- `db.js` - Handles database connection.
- `routes/` - Contains API routes.
- `models/` - Database models.

## Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build a **scalable full-stack application** from scratch.
- Implement **secure authentication mechanisms**.
- Develop and manage a **RESTful API**.
- Design a **responsive and user-friendly UI**.
- Integrate **MongoDB as a database solution**.

## Deployment (Optional)
